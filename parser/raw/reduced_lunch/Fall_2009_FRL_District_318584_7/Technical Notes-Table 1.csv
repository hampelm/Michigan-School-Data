Data sources,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michigan Student Data System (MSDS) Good Student Records (GSR): This file includes data from Supplemental Nutrition Eligibility (SNE) and Student Record Maintenance (SRM) Collections. Records taken from the SRM were used only if the date found in AsOfDate was between 09/30/2009 and 10/30/2009 and the Certification Date was prior to January 1, 2010. The field, AsOfDate, is the date the reported information became effective for the student. ",,,,,,,,,,,

Processing,,,,,,,,,,,
"The purpose of the report is to count students who were identified as being eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Data were pulled from the Michigan Student Data System (MSDS) using Good Student Records (GSR, 10-30-2009). The primary fields for the calculations were the PovertyIndicator and EligibleForFreeLunch flags. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"A positive value (""true"") for the PovertyIndicator flag indicated eligibility for either free or reduced-price lunch. A positive value (""true"") for the EligibleForFreeLunch flag indicated eligibility for free lunch. Students who had a positive value for PovertyIndicator but not for EligibleForFreeLunch were designated as having eligibility for reduced-price lunch. Students with values of ""false"" for both PovertyIndicator and EligibleForFreeLunch were classified as not eligible. ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Students identified as migrants or homeless, or who had direct certification eligibility, were counted as eligible for free lunch, regardless of how they were reported by districts. ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that the data represent counts occurring from September 30 (the September count date) through October 30, 2009. Previous counts occurred as of the September count date.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Student were included if the District Exit Status = ""19"" (continuing students only). Also, students who had a total full-time equivalency (FTE) of zero were included, as long as they were continuing. Previous counts required a total FTE to be greater than zero.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Students were excluded if they were in nonpublic schools or if they were identified as homeschooled or nonpublic students by codes in the student residency field (""04"",""07"",""08"", and ""15"").",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
The district and building names were pulled from the EEM. ,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Students were grouped into K-12, adult education and early childhood. Adult education students were included in the current report but early childhood students will be added in the future. The K-12 group consists of grades kindergarten through twelfth, plus the ungraded special education (grade=""14""). Students reported in an adult education program and reported in a K-12 grade were included as adult education (grade = ""20"") rather than in K-12 counts. ",,,,,,,,,,,

Duplicate handling,,,,,,,,,,,
State level:,,,,,,,,,,,
"After merging with EEM, the data file was first sorted on UIC, Supplemental Nutrition Eligibility (where 1=free lunch eligible, 2=reduced-price lunch eligible and 3=not eligible), descending total FTE and grade. The data were then deduplicated on Unique Identification Code (UIC). ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
District level:,,,,,,,,,,,
"The data file was first sorted on UIC, Dcode, Supplemental Nutrition Eligibility, descending total FTE and grade. The data were then deduplicated on UIC and Dcode.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Building level:,,,,,,,,,,,
"The data file was first sorted on UIC, Dcode, Bcode, Supplemental Nutrition Eligibility, descending total FTE and grade. The data were then deduplicated on UIC, Dcode and Bcode.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"If duplicate records were found using the specified sort fields, records were kept in the following manner: Free lunch eligibility records were kept first, then reduced-price lunch eligibility records and lastly, not eligible records. This was to ensure that any students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches were counted if duplicate records were found.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Additional notes,,,,,,,,,,,
Enrollment figures include students from Fall 2009 General Collection (September 30 count) and students who may have entered school after the count and who were counted in the Supplemental Nutrition Eligibility collection. Also included were students in Student Record Maintenance if the AsOfDate was September 30 through October 30 and the certification date before January 1.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the building-level data files, the state district code from the EEM (84050) is used for students reported at the Michigan School for the Deaf/Blind (building code of 02548) and MSB-Low Incidence Outreach (building code of 02534), rather than the reported district code. In the district-level file, students from the school are counted with the reporting district.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"For regional educational service agency/intermediate school district (RESA/ISD) students attending a local education agency (LEA) school not directly operated by the RESA/ISD, a school code of ""00000"" and a school name of ""RESA/ISD students attending LEA school"" were assigned. [For example: Most students attending the school with the assigned building code of 00307 were counted under the district code of 03040, but a few students were reported at the ISD-level, under district code 03000 and were assigned building code 00000.]",,,,,,,,,,,
